  Supervisor: Professor Neil, Mark A A and Doctor Weir, Kenny
In collaboration with the group, an optical tweezer system was perfectly constructed using a lens, laser, and microscope to capture polystyrene particles of 5 microns in diameter
Be able to reasonably analyze the reasons for failure and directions for improvement during the build process, and provide ideas and suggestions for optimizing the system after a successful test
Laser filamentation and air lasing | Leader                                                                                 06/2023-09/2023
Supervisor: Professor Matthews, Mary
During the three-month period, the existing literature and the laboratory conditions was combined to construct a partially mobile and easy-to-observe filament fabrication device, and explored in detail the basic characteristics of Laser Filamentation and its spectral broadening by varying the laser power, changing the focal length of the lens, and inserting the BBO crystals, etc., in order to understand the quantitative effects of various variables on the spectral broadening
Achieved the spectral broadening of 400nm in the literature, and can analyse in detail the various side phenomena encountered in the process, such as Raman shift, third harmonic generation, discuss the other conditions required for air lasing, such as laser power, beam radius and other factors
Developed the ability to think through and plan the path to achieve defined goals in a project, and to keep detailed records of experiments for repeated review and validation
